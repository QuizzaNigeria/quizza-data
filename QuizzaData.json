    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A transitive verb is one that takes a direct object. In the sentence 'She reads a book every day,' the verb 'reads' is transitive because it has the direct object 'a book'. A direct object answers the question 'What?' or 'Whom?' after the verb. In this case, 'What does she read?' The answer is 'a book'."

      "Talk",
      "Go",
      "Jump"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "'Go' is an irregular verb because its past tense is 'went', which doesn't follow the regular pattern of adding 'ed' to the base verb. For example, 'walk' becomes 'walked', and 'talk' becomes 'talked', following the regular pattern. 'Go' is an exception."

    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "'Ate' is the simple past tense of the verb 'eat'. Simple past tense is used to talk about actions that happened and finished in the past. For example, 'I ate lunch an hour ago.' 'Eaten' is the past participle, used with auxiliary verbs like 'have' or 'had'."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A helping verb (also known as an auxiliary verb) is used with a main verb to form different tenses, voices, or moods. In the sentence 'She has finished her homework', 'has' is the helping verb, and 'finished' is the main verb.

    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "The verb 'am running' is in the present continuous tense, which is used to describe an action happening at the moment of speaking.

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 0,
    "explanation": "The past perfect tense is used to show that one action happened before another action in the past. The past perfect is formed with 'had' + the past participle of the verb. In the example 'had eaten,' the action of eating was completed before another past event. For example, 'I had eaten lunch before he arrived.'"

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "A modal verb is used to express possibility, ability, permission, or obligation. In the sentence 'She can swim very well,' the verb 'can' is a modal verb, indicating ability.

      "The cake is eaten by the children."
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "explanation": "In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action rather than performing it. In the sentence 'The cake was eaten by the children,' the subject 'the cake' is the recipient of the action, and the verb 'was eaten' is in the passive voice. Active voice would be 'The children ate the cake.'"

    ],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "'Walk' is a regular verb because its past tense is formed by adding 'ed' (walked). Regular verbs follow a predictable pattern, where you simply add 'ed' to form the past tense. For example, 'talk' becomes 'talked,' 'jump' becomes 'jumped.' Irregular verbs, like 'go' and 'eat,' do not follow this pattern."
